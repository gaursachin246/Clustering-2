    "## Hierarchical clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm that builds a hierarchy of clusters by merging or splitting existing clusters. It's different from other clustering techniques in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. Tree-like structure: Hierarchical clustering creates a tree-like structure, known as a dendrogram, which shows the hierarchical relationships between clusters.\n",
    "#2. No fixed number of clusters: Unlike K-means, hierarchical clustering doesn't require specifying the number of clusters in advance.\n",
    "#3. Agglomerative or divisive: Hierarchical clustering can be either agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down).\n",
    "#4. Distance metric flexibility: Hierarchical clustering can use various distance metrics, such as Euclidean, Manhattan, or cosine distance.\n",
    "#5. Handling varying densities: Hierarchical clustering can handle clusters with varying densities and shapes.\n",
